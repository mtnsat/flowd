These are the platforms that flowd is tested on, along with any relevant notes.

Platform		Status		Testing		Notes
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Debian (unstable)	OK		some		[1]
Fedora Core 2		OK		well-tested	[1]
OpenBSD 3.5+		OK		well-tested
Redhat 9		OK		tested		[1] [2]
Redhat 7.3		OK		in production	[1] [2] [4]
Solaris 9		OK		tested		[1] [3]
FreeBSD			Reportedly OK			probably [1]

Notes:
------

[1] Most operating systems don't set up /var/empty/dev/log to capture log
messages from chrooted processes like OpenBSD does. This causes log messages 
from the unprivileged flowd instance to be lost. For Redhat-derived
distributions, you can modify the syslog options line in /etc/sysconfig/syslog
to add a listener. E.g.:

SYSLOGD_OPTIONS="-m 0 -a /var/empty/dev/log"

[2] Python-2.3 or greater is required and this platform lacks it by default,
so the Python API is unavailable, unless you have manually installed an
appropriate Python version.

[3] Solaris includes Berkeley yacc by default, but you will need to add 
/usr/ccs/bin to your $PATH. E.g.

PATH=$PATH:/usr/ccs/bin ./configure [...]

[4] The RPM installation on RedHat 7.3 needs a little manual hand-holding, 
because useradd and groupadd won't create users or groups with leading 
underscores in their names. You will need to create the _flowd user and group
manually.
